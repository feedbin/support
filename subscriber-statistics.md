Subscriber Statistics
=====================

Feedbinâ€™s feed reader uses a [`User-Agent` header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) to identify itself when requesting a feed. The header looks like the following:

```
Feedbin - X subscribers
```

`X` will be replaced with the number of accounts that are subscribed to the requested feed, e.g.:

```
Feedbin - 12 subscribers
```

The word `subscribers` will never lose its plural s, e.g.:

```
Feedbin - 1 subscribers
```
